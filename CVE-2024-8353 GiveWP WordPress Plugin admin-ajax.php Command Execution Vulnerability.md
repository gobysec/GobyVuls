# CVE-2024-8353 GiveWP WordPress Plugin admin-ajax.php Command Execution Vulnerability

GiveWP is a very popular WordPress plugin designed for non-profit organizations and individuals to accept online donations.

A PHP object injection vulnerability exists in the GiveWP Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform Plugin for WordPress, affecting all versions up to and including version 3.16.1. The vulnerability is generated by deserializing several parameters (such as 'give_title' and 'card_address') of untrustworthy input. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject PHP objects. In addition, the presence of a POP chain allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files and enable remote code execution.
**Affected version**: affecting all versions up to and including version 3.16.1

**[FOFA] query rule**: body="/wp-content/plugins/give/" && body="wp-includes"
